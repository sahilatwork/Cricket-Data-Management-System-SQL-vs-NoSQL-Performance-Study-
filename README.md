# Data Management System (SQL vs NoSQL Performance Study)

### 📌 Overview
This project was developed to **showcase advanced SQL skills** through the design and implementation of a **Cricket Event Management System**.  
The system manages **stadium bookings, availability tracking, player statistics, and tournament scheduling**, using **Stored Procedures, Triggers, and User-Defined Functions (UDFs)** to ensure automation, data integrity, and performance optimization.

In addition, a **NoSQL implementation (Couchbase)** was developed to compare performance, scalability, and schema design differences between **relational (SQL)** and **non-relational (NoSQL)** approaches.

### ⚙️ Features
- 🏟️ Manage stadium bookings and check availability.  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Track player statistics and match history.  
- 🗓️ Schedule and organize tournaments dynamically.  
- ⚡ Implemented **Stored Procedures, Triggers, and UDFs** for data consistency and automation.  
- 🔁 Built a **parallel NoSQL version** to benchmark SQL vs NoSQL approaches.  
- 📊 Performance and data modeling comparison across database paradigms.

### 🧰 Tech Stack
**Languages & Tools**
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** – schema design, queries, triggers, stored procedures  
- **Couchbase Server** – NoSQL implementation and comparison  
- **Visual Studio** – Object Role Modeling and application logic  
- **C#** – front-end logic for interaction with SQL and NoSQL databases  
- **JSON** – NoSQL document structure
